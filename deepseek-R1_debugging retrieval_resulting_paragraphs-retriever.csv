H25-29-O,Y,['659'],"When a merchant receives a deposit within the scope of his/her business, he/she shall have the due care of a prudent manager for the deposited goods even when he/she will not receive any remuneration.",riteval_H25_en.xml,"<think>Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user is asking about a situation where a merchant receives a deposit as part of their business and must exercise the due care of a prudent manager, even without remuneration. They provided two paragraphs: 644 and 400.

First, I need to understand each paragraph. Paragraph 644 talks about a mandatary's duty to act with the care of a prudent manager as per the mandate. A mandatary typically refers to someone acting under a mandate, which is like a contract where they manage affairs for another. This paragraph emphasizes compliance with the mandate's main purpose.

Paragraph 400 deals with the obligation to deliver a specific thing. The obligor must retain the item with the same standard of care until delivery, considering the contract and common transaction practices. This seems more about custody of goods in a delivery context.

The query is about a merchant holding deposited goods in their business, requiring prudent care without payment. The key points here are deposit within business scope, no remuneration, and the standard of care.

Comparing to the paragraphs: 644 involves mandates, which usually involve some form of agreement, possibly without remuneration. However, mandates can sometimes be gratuitous. The duty here is directly about prudent management in line with the mandate's purpose. The query's scenario is a deposit in business, which might be a mandate situation. If the merchant is acting under a mandate (even unpaid), 644 applies.

Paragraph 400 is about retaining goods for delivery, which is a specific performance context. The query is about deposits, not necessarily delivery obligations. However, if the deposit is part of a contract where the merchant must later return the goods, 400 might be relevant. But the query emphasizes that it's within the merchant's business scope, which might align more with a mandate (business services) than a delivery obligation.

So, which is more relevant? The query's mention of ""deposit within the scope of his/her business"" suggests a business service, possibly under a mandate. Even without remuneration, the mandate (paragraph 644) would require prudent care. Paragraph 400 is about retaining for delivery, which might not directly apply to a deposit scenario unless the deposit is part of a delivery obligation. Since the query doesn't mention delivery but deposit, 644 seems more fitting. However, if the deposit is considered a situation where the merchant must later return the goods (similar to delivery), 400 could be applicable. But the primary context of 644 (mandate) seems closer to the merchant's duty in handling deposits as part of their business services, even unpaid. Therefore, 644 is more relevant. The user might need both if the deposit is seen as part of a delivery obligation, but the initial thought is 644 first, then 400 if applicable. Wait, but the query specifically mentions ""deposited goods"" and ""due care of a prudent manager"" without remuneration. Paragraph 644's mandate scenario could be gratuitous (without payment), which matches the ""no remuneration"" part. So 644 directly applies. Paragraph 400 is about"

The user provided a legal query and a list of paragraphs. The task is to determine which paragraphs are relevant and rank them. The query is about a guarantor who hasn't been entrusted by the principal obligor and whether they can perform the obligation against the principal's will.

First, I need to understand the query. The key points here are ""guarantor without entrustment"" and ""performing the obligation against the principal's will."" The user is asking if such a guarantor can act against the principal's wishes.

Looking at the provided paragraph, it's §462(1) which references §459-2(1). The paragraph states that if a person gives a guarantee without the principal's request and performs an act to extinguish the obligation, the provisions of §459-2(1) apply mutatis mutandis. 

Now, I need to recall what §459-2(1) says. Although it's not provided here, typically, such provisions might deal with the rights of a guarantor who acts without being requested. For example, maybe §459-2(1) outlines that a guarantor who acts without the principal's request can't claim reimbursement or might have limited rights. If that's the case, then applying it here would mean the guarantor can't extinguish the obligation against the principal's will.

The query states that the guarantor may not perform the obligation against the principal's will. The paragraph in §462(1) seems to align with this by applying §459-2(1) rules to such a scenario. Therefore, §462 is directly relevant because it addresses a guarantor acting without the principal's request and the consequences of their actions.

Since there's only one paragraph provided, the ranking is straightforward. But I need to check if there are any other possible paragraphs mentioned. The user listed only §462, so the answer should include that. The format requires the response to be in a list, even if there's only one entry. Also, the instructions say to return an empty list if no paragraphs are found, but here there is one"
